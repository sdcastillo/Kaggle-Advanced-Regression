# Kaggle-Advanced-Regression
A submission to a kaggle competition

## Project Overview

This project applies advanced regression techniques to predict housing prices and analyze real estate market dynamics. The analysis draws insights from the 2008 housing bubble, a critical period that reshaped the residential real estate market.

## Real Estate Bubble Connection

The 2008 housing bubble represents one of the most significant financial crises in modern history. The bubble was characterized by:
- Unprecedented price inflation in residential real estate
- Loose lending standards and subprime mortgage proliferation
- Disconnect between fundamentals and market valuations
- Widespread defaults when prices corrected

This competition uses regression analysis to model these dynamics and develop predictive models that could identify overvalued markets.

## Connection to Expedia Group Property Work

This analysis directly applies experience from working on property-related projects at Expedia Group, where understanding real estate valuations, market trends, and pricing dynamics are essential for:
- Vacation rental and property listings optimization
- Dynamic pricing models for accommodations
- Market analysis and competitive positioning
- Data-driven insights into regional real estate trends

The techniques developed here leverage similar methodologies used in large-scale property valuation platforms, enabling better predictions of housing market behavior and identifying key factors that drive property values.

## Regression Techniques

This Kaggle competition focuses on building advanced regression models to predict housing prices using:
- Feature engineering and selection
- Regularization techniques (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net)
- Ensemble methods
- Cross-validation and model evaluation

## Files and Structure

- Training data from Kaggle's housing dataset
- Model implementations with comparative analysis
- Insights into feature importance and market drivers
